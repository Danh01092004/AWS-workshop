# Secure Cloud Innovation Starts at re:Inforce 2025  

## Balancing Speed and Security  
Every day, I speak with security leaders who are facing an important balance. On one hand, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting breakthrough technologies like **generative AI** and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other hand, they need to maintain strong security controls and visibility in an increasingly complex environment.  

We all know that simply adding more tools and security layers is not a sustainable path. We need a different approach that enables security to scale.  

## re:Inforce 2025: A Security Roadmap that Accelerates Innovation  
This is the driving force behind our vision for [**AWS re:Inforce 2025**](https://reinforce.awsevents.com). When implemented correctly, security at scale is not a barrier, but becomes a **business enabler**, helping organizations move faster and with greater confidence in the cloud.  

At re:Inforce, we will share our perspective on **simplifying security at scale**, based on our experience supporting millions of customers worldwide. We will explore how organizations are building inherently resilient applications that both defend against modern threats and drive innovation. I am particularly excited to showcase **real-world customer examples** and **reference architectures** that demonstrate how security can directly support business objectives.  

## An Immersive Cloud Security Learning Environment  
We created **re:Inforce** as a specialized, in-person event for the security community. Unlike broad AWS events, re:Inforce provides the space to:  

- Dive deep into implementation details.  
- Ask tough questions.  
- Solve complex scenarios.  

Here, you can directly engage with the engineers who built AWS security services, collaborate with security partners, or schedule one-on-one sessions with AWS leaders to address your specific needs. This is the environment where true learning happens.  

We have designed multiple **learning paths** to fit every stage of your cloud security journey. With more than **250 technical sessions**, you will find content that matches your needs — from automating security controls, aligning development and security teams, to transforming security operations.  

Key activities include:  
- Interactive workshops where you can build solutions on the spot.  
- Small-group technical chalk talks.  
- Hands-on labs to experiment with new approaches.  
- “Solution-building” sessions with AWS experts.  

Importantly, **70% of the content is advanced or expert level**, ensuring the detailed implementation guidance you need.
