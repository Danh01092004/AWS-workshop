	"content": "How AWS Protects Customers from DDoS Events Overview Since late August 2023, AWS detected and protected against a new kind of DDoS event: an HTTP/2 request flood, specifically called an HTTP/2 rapid reset attack, targeting Amazon CloudFront. These floods suddenly sent huge volumes of HTTP/2 connection requests followed rapidly by resets, overwhelming servers by forcing them to log and parse requests before cancellation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\nKey Event Details The spike occurred August 28–29, 2023, peaking at over 155 million requests per second via CloudFront. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} AWS observed and mitigated multiple of these HTTP/2 rapid reset events in that period, then continued seeing them into September. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} Customers with DDoS-resilient architectures — using services like CloudFront, AWS Shield — maintained availability during those attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} Understanding HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attacks HTTP/2 allows multiple logical streams over one session, different from HTTP/1.x. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} Attackers issue many requests, then quickly reset each stream. Servers still incur overhead: parsing, logging, etc., even if response isn\u0026rsquo;t delivered. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} These are a subclass of HTTP request floods; important to detect and absorb malicious traffic before it reaches origin systems. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} AWS’s Defensive Measures and Best Practices AWS provides built-in DDoS protection across its infrastructure. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} Key services to use for resilience: Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield (including Shield Advanced), AWS WAF, Amazon Route 53, Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. These help when serving traffic from global edge locations, preventing unnecessary requests from reaching origin servers. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} Use caching at edge (e.g. CloudFront), careful filtering (WAF), and global routing/resiliency (Route 53) to absorb or block malicious traffic. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} Threat Intelligence, Monitoring, and Collaboration AWS continuously monitors for unusual traffic patterns and works proactively to detect threats. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} Engineers combine global threat intelligence, telemetry, and automated mitigation to stay ahead of new DDoS methods. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} AWS collaborates with external entities (CERTs, ISPs, registrars, other cloud providers) to trace, mitigate, and sometimes dismantle sources of large DDoS attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} Summary AWS responded swiftly to a novel HTTP/2 rapid reset DDoS attack in late August/early September 2023. Thanks to built-in protections + resilience-focused architectures using services like CloudFront, Shield, WAF, and Route 53, customers were able to maintain availability. Ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence, and infrastructure-level mitigations are central to AWS’s approach to protecting from evolving DDoS threats.\n"

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Documentation: Provide technical documentation, best practices, architectural guides, and handover training to the customer\u0026rsquo;s engineering team 1.2 Project Success Criteria Project Success Criteria\nSystem availability ≥ 99.9% uptime across all production services (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront).\nPage load time \u0026lt; 2.5 seconds for the main user interface delivered through CloudFront and Amplify.\nAPI response time \u0026lt; 300 ms for 90% of all user-facing API requests under normal traffic conditions.\nAI processing latency \u0026lt; 5 seconds for recipe suggestions generated by AWS Bedrock.\nUser authentication success rate ≥ 98% with Cognito handling registration, login, and email verification.\nZero critical security vulnerabilities after security review and WAF rules deployment.\nData durability of 99.999999999% (11 nines) ensured through S3 object storage and DynamoDB.\nScalability to support 10,000+ concurrent users without degradation in performance due to serverless infrastructure.\nOperational cost control within target budget: monthly AWS usage not exceeding $200 for production.\nImage upload \u0026amp; processing success rate ≥ 99%, supported by S3, Lambda Workers, and SQS.\nSearch performance under 1 second (if OpenSearch is enabled) for recipe/content search queries.\nMonitoring coverage of 100% critical services using CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and X-Ray tracing.\nCI/CD deployment time \u0026lt; 5 minutes via GitHub → Amplify and IaC automation.\nZero data loss events, ensured by DynamoDB PITR and S3 versioning.\n1.3 Assumptions The customer will provide full access to their domain registrar (Hostinger) to configure DNS delegation to Route 53.\nThe customer will provide valid AWS account access with Administrator privileges for deployment and configuration.\nAll required AWS services (Amplify, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, Cognito, Bedrock, SES) are available and supported in the chosen region.\nSES will be successfully moved out of the sandbox and approved for production email sending.\nThird-party integrations (GitHub for CI/CD, external email clients, image upload sources) will remain available and stable.\nThe development team will maintain source code quality and follow the architectural guidelines provided by the partner.\nThe customer will provide timely feedback and approvals during design, testing, and deployment phases.\nDependencies\nReliable internet connectivity is required for all users accessing the web application and APIs.\nThe system depends on AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for AI recipe generation and may experience performance fluctuations if the model becomes rate-limited.\nImage upload and processing workflows depend on S3, Lambda, and SQS processing reliability.\nIf OpenSearch is enabled, search features rely on the availability of the OpenSearch domain.\nGitHub Actions and Amplify depend on GitHub service availability.\nConstraints\nThe project will be fully deployed in a single AWS region, which may impact latency for users outside the region.\nThe solution is designed using serverless patterns; custom EC2-based workloads are outside the project scope.\nSES domain reputation may affect email deliverability during initial weeks.\nOpenSearch is deployed as a single-node cluster for cost efficiency, which means no high availability for search indexing.\nThe system must stay within the customer\u0026rsquo;s cost target (\u0026lt; $200/month), limiting the use of large compute resources.\nRisks\nSES production approval may be delayed, impacting user onboarding emails and notifications.\nIf traffic grows unexpectedly, DynamoDB provisioned capacity may throttle without timely scaling adjustments.\nAI model cost or latency changes by AWS may impact application performance or cost control.\nMisconfigured CloudFront caching could lead to higher latency or increased data transfer cost.\nAny incorrect IAM configuration could lead to security risks or service disruption.\nCustomer team turnover or lack of DevOps skills may slow down future maintenance or deployments.\n2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram The proposed solution architecture for the AI-powered cooking social network platform is designed using a fully serverless and scalable AWS cloud-native stack. The architecture ensures high availability,security, and seamless integration between the web frontend, backend APIs, authentication, data storage, and AI recommendation services. Below is a description of the key components and how data flows across the system: 1. Network \u0026amp; Edge Layer\nAmazon Route 53 (6\u0026ndash;7)\nProvides DNS routing for the custom domain used by the platform. Incoming HTTPS requests from users are resolved and forwarded to CloudFront. Amazon CloudFront (9)\nActs as a global CDN distributing frontend content with low latency while caching static files. AWS WAF (8)\nProtects the application from common web exploits such as SQL injection, XSS, and bot attacks. 2. Frontend Hosting \u0026amp; Deployment\nAWS Amplify Hosting (4)\nHosts and deploys the Next.js frontend application. Integrated with GitLab CI/CD (3) for automated deployments from the development workflow. 3. Application Layer\nAmazon Cognito (10)\nHandles user authentication and authorization, supporting email/password and social logins. Amazon API Gateway (11)\nServes as the main entry point for backend APIs, exposing REST endpoints used by the frontend. AWS Lambda (12, 15)\nContains the backend business logic, including:\nuser management\npost and recipe operations\ningredient analysis\nconnecting to Bedrock for AI recommendations\nThis serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling and pay-per-use cost efficiency.\n4. AI Recommendation Layer\nAmazon Bedrock (16\u0026ndash;17)\nProvides generative AI capabilities to suggest recipes based on user-provided ingredients.\nLambda invokes Bedrock models (e.g., Claude, Titan) to:\nanalyze ingredient lists\ngenerate recipe suggestions\nclassify food categories\noptimize cooking steps.\n5. Data Storage Layer\nAmazon DynamoDB (13)\nStores structured application data such as:\nuser profiles\nposts/recipes\nlikes \u0026amp; comments\ningredient metadata.\nAmazon S3 (14)\nStores unstructured data:\nrecipe images\nuser-uploaded food photos\nstatic content.\nAn S3 bucket is integrated with CloudFront via OAI for secure access.\n6. Observability \u0026amp; Security Layer\nAmazon CloudWatch (Logs \u0026amp; Metrics)\nMonitors Lambda performance, API Gateway access logs, and system metrics.\nAWS X-Ray\nPerforms distributed tracing for API calls and debugging.\nIAM\nDefines permission boundaries between API, Lambda functions, Bedrock, DynamoDB, and S3.\nAmazon SES\nSends verification emails, notifications, and password recovery messages.\nAmazon SNS\nHandles system-level alerts and asynchronous messaging.\n7. Deployment \u0026amp; Infrastructure Management\nAWS CDK (1\u0026ndash;2)\nUsed by developers to define and provision the entire infrastructure via CloudFormation templates.\nEnsures consistent, reproducible, version-controlled deployments. 2.2 Technical Plan Partner will develop Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) automation using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) with TypeScript/Python to provision the entire cloud environment. This approach ensures quick, consistent, and repeatable deployments across multiple AWS accounts and environments (dev, staging, production). All resources such as API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, Cognito user pools, Bedrock integration policies, and CloudFront distributions will be fully automated via IaC.\nApplication build and deployment processes for the frontend (Next.js) will be automated using AWS Amplify Hosting, integrated with GitLab pipelines. Backend components will be deployed through CDK pipelines to ensure controlled, versioned, and repeatable releases.\nSome additional configuration such as custom domain setup, Route 53 DNS changes, SSL/TLS certificate issuance, and IAM permission approvals may require customer review and approval. These changes will follow the customer's existing change management process, including scheduled maintenance windows and documented approvals from the security/compliance teams.\nAll critical paths, including authentication flows, AI recipe suggestion APIs, data persistence logic, and image upload workflows, will undergo extensive test coverage. Automated tests (unit, integration, and API-level) will be executed in CI/CD pipelines, and manual validation will be performed in the staging environment before production deployment.\n2.3 Project Plan [Partner] will adopt the Agile Scrum framework across eight 2-week sprints. Stakeholders from the team are required to participate in Sprint Reviews and Sprint Retrospectives to ensure alignment and continuous improvement.\nThe proposed team responsibilities are as follows:\nProduct Owner: Define user stories, prioritize backlog, and ensure the product meets user needs.\nScrum Master**:** Facilitate Scrum ceremonies, remove blockers, and maintain team productivity.\nDevelopment Team: Implement features, conduct unit testing, and collaborate on integration.\nAI/ML Specialist: Develop and fine-tune the AI recommendation engine that suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients.\nUI/UX Designer: Design intuitive interfaces and ensure a smooth user experience on both web and mobile platforms.\nQA/Testers**:** Validate feature functionality, conduct regression testing, and ensure system reliability.\nCommunication cadences will be established as follows:\nDaily Stand-ups**:** 15-minute meetings for progress updates and immediate blockers.\nSprint Planning**:** At the start of each sprint to prioritize tasks.\nSprint Review: At the end of each sprint to showcase completed features to stakeholders.\nSprint Retrospective**:** Following each sprint review to identify improvements for the next sprint.\nKnowledge transfer sessions will be conducted by the senior developers and AI specialists to ensure team members understand system architecture, AI integration, and deployment procedures.\n2.4 Security Considerations Partner will implement security best practices across the following five categories to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the platform:\nAccess Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user and administrative accounts.\nImplement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, moderator, contributor).\nEnforce strong password policies and periodic password rotation.\nInfrastructure Deploy the application on secure, managed cloud services (e.g., AWS) following AWS security best practices.\nUse Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), network segmentation, and security groups to isolate resources.\nRegularly patch operating systems and containerized services to mitigate vulnerabilities.\nData Encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS-managed keys and data in transit using TLS/HTTPS.\nImplement data classification to protect sensitive user information (e.g., email, profile data, dietary preferences).\nApply secure data storage and backup procedures to ensure availability and integrity.\nDetection Enable AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to monitor API activity and resource configurations.\nDeploy logging and alerting mechanisms to detect unusual or suspicious activities in real time.\nConduct periodic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing on the platform.\nIncident Management Establish a formal incident response plan including detection, containment, remediation, and communication.\nMaintain audit trails and logs to support forensic investigation if a security event occurs.\nEnsure [Customer] shares regulatory control validations to help [Partner] meet all compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, local privacy regulations).\nBy adhering to these measures, Partner ensures that the social cooking platform remains secure, compliant, and resilient against potential threats.\n3.

	"content": "Secure Cloud Innovation Starts at re:Inforce 2025 Balancing Speed and Security Every day, I speak with security leaders who are facing an important balance. On one hand, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting breakthrough technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other hand, they need to maintain strong security controls and visibility in an increasingly complex environment.\nWe all know that simply adding more tools and security layers is not a sustainable path. We need a different approach that enables security to scale.\nre:Inforce 2025: A Security Roadmap that Accelerates Innovation This is the driving force behind our vision for AWS re:Inforce 2025. When implemented correctly, security at scale is not a barrier, but becomes a business enabler, helping organizations move faster and with greater confidence in the cloud.\nAt re:Inforce, we will share our perspective on simplifying security at scale, based on our experience supporting millions of customers worldwide. We will explore how organizations are building inherently resilient applications that both defend against modern threats and drive innovation. I am particularly excited to showcase real-world customer examples and reference architectures that demonstrate how security can directly support business objectives.\nAn Immersive Cloud Security Learning Environment We created re:Inforce as a specialized, in-person event for the security community. Unlike broad AWS events, re:Inforce provides the space to:\nDive deep into implementation details. Ask tough questions. Solve complex scenarios. Here, you can directly engage with the engineers who built AWS security services, collaborate with security partners, or schedule one-on-one sessions with AWS leaders to address your specific needs. This is the environment where true learning happens.\nWe have designed multiple learning paths to fit every stage of your cloud security journey. With more than 250 technical sessions, you will find content that matches your needs — from automating security controls, aligning development and security teams, to transforming security operations.\nKey activities include:\nInteractive workshops where you can build solutions on the spot. Small-group technical chalk talks. Hands-on labs to experiment with new approaches. “Solution-building” sessions with AWS experts. Importantly, 70% of the content is advanced or expert level, ensuring the detailed implementation guidance you need.\nJoin Us at re:Inforce 2025 I invite you to join us for three days of experience that will transform how you think about and implement cloud security.\nRegister today with code SECBLObhZzr9 to receive a limited-time $300 USD discount. Hurry, as seats are going fast based on past experience.\nTogether, we will explore how simple, scalable cloud security can become the driving force for your organization’s future.\n"

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

	"content": "Amazon Inspector Suppression Rules: Best Practices for AWS Organizations Delegated Administrator Setup Designate a single AWS account as the delegated administrator for Amazon Inspector. This account can centrally manage scans, aggregate findings, and apply suppression rules across all accounts in your AWS Organization. Benefits include:\nCentralized visibility of vulnerabilities Consistent policy enforcement Reduced administrative overhead Steps:\nEnable AWS Organizations and add member accounts. Assign the delegated admin role for Amazon Inspector. Verify access and permissions across accounts. Suppression Rules at Scale Suppression rules help filter out low-risk findings automatically, allowing security teams to focus on critical vulnerabilities. Key points:\nRules can be based on finding attributes, resource tags, or CVSS scores. Suppressed findings are archived, not deleted, ensuring auditability. Rules can be applied to multiple accounts using delegated admin. Example: Suppress findings for non-production EC2 instances tagged Environment:Dev with low CVSS scores (\u0026lt;4).\nTagging and Risk-Based Prioritization Using tags consistently across resources allows teams to prioritize vulnerabilities by business impact:\nTag by environment (Prod, Dev, Test) Tag by application owner Tag by compliance requirements Inspector can use these tags to generate reports and apply suppression selectively, aligning vulnerability management with business priorities.\nContinuous Review and Improvement Suppression rules and scan configurations are not “set and forget.” Continuous monitoring ensures effectiveness:\nReview suppressed findings regularly to confirm rules remain valid. Adjust scan schedules, coverage, and scope to adapt to new services or workloads. Use aggregated reports from delegated admin account to identify trends and gaps. Benefits include:\nMaintaining compliance with security standards Reducing alert fatigue for security teams Ensuring timely remediation of critical vulnerabilities Multi-Account Considerations Managing suppression rules across multiple AWS accounts requires careful planning:\nUse AWS Organizations with delegated admin to avoid rule duplication. Apply inheritance patterns for member accounts. Combine tagging strategies with suppression rules to target specific accounts or workloads. This approach provides consistent security policies while enabling scalability and flexibility for growing organizations.\nConclusion By leveraging delegated admin, suppression rules, tagging, and continuous review, organizations can efficiently manage vulnerabilities at scale using Amazon Inspector. Following these best practices ensures that security teams focus on critical issues while maintaining auditability and compliance across all AWS accounts.\n"

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

	"content": "AWS for Games: Jackbox Games Opens New Opportunities with Amazon GameLift Streams By David Holladay March 6, 2025\nTags: Amazon CloudFront, Amazon GameLift, Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Customer Solutions, Game Development, Games, Messaging, Networking \u0026amp; Content Delivery, Storage, Industries\nIntroduction Jackbox Games is a Chicago-based game studio renowned for party games like Quiplash, Fibbage, Drawful, Trivia Murder Party, and many others. With over 50 games in its catalog, Jackbox pursues a mission of \u0026ldquo;accessible gaming\u0026rdquo; enabling players to participate from any device they have. The company\u0026rsquo;s entire server infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.\nPreviously, players typically used a TV to display the game and a phone as a controller a simple but widely popular play style. Recently, Jackbox decided to partner with Amazon GameLift Streams to deliver installation-free, instant-access gaming experiences to players.\nAmazon GameLift Streams is a feature within GameLift that enables games to be streamed with low latency, high frame rates, and global scale helping studios like Jackbox expand their reach without depending on consoles or powerful devices.\n1. Cost Control While Scaling Bringing a game to a streaming platform can be expensive if done in isolation. Jackbox has a very large catalog, so they needed a way to optimize costs.\n1.1 Creating a Stream Group for All Games AWS partnered with Jackbox to consolidate all 50 games into a single Stream Group within Amazon GameLift Streams. This allows them to scale their entire catalog together rather than managing each game individually.\n1.2 Multi-tenancy \u0026amp; Reduced Resource Costs Because Jackbox games don\u0026rsquo;t require powerful GPUs, a single server instance can run multiple games simultaneously implementing a multi-tenancy model to save on costs.\n1.3 Using Data Channels to Insert Ads Amazon GameLift Streams provides a Data Channel feature that allows ads to be inserted at appropriate moments between game rounds helping Jackbox sustain a free-to-play model or support revenue through advertising.\n2. Improved Update and Release Processes 2.1 Traditional Party Pack Model \u0026amp; Limitations Previously, Jackbox released games in Party Packs each bundle containing 5 games. Updating a single game required updating the entire pack across all platforms, creating complexity in management and deployment.\n2.2 Streaming Enables Flexible, Individual Updates With GameLift Streams, Jackbox can update a single game on the server without affecting others, regardless of platform differences. This also allows players to seamlessly transition between games without closing and reopening bundles.\n2.3 Increased Game Discoverability When all games are accessible through the streaming service, players have more opportunities to try new games immediately rather than being limited to bundles they\u0026rsquo;ve previously purchased.\n3. Support \u0026amp; Deep Integration with AWS 3.1 Technical Support Integrated into Slack During deployment, AWS supported Jackbox directly through their Slack enabling the development team to communicate easily and resolve issues quickly. Jackbox\u0026rsquo;s CTO noted that this experience made AWS feel like part of their team.\n3.2 Using Multiple AWS Services Beyond GameLift Streams, Jackbox uses several AWS services to operate their system:\nAmazon EC2 for backend processing and session management Amazon S3 for storing game assets and data Amazon SQS for queue management Amazon CloudFront for fast and reliable content distribution All these services fit seamlessly within the AWS ecosystem Jackbox was already using.\n4. Future Direction \u0026amp; Vision Jackbox is excited about reaching new players through popular devices like Smart TVs without requiring a console. They envision an experience similar to opening a streaming app (like Netflix) to play games instantly.\nStreaming also enables Jackbox to explore partnerships with other studios, bringing games from different engines into their service expanding their catalog faster. Jackbox\u0026rsquo;s CTO emphasizes that streaming opens a \u0026ldquo;new business model\u0026rdquo; impossible with traditional Party Pack structures subscription, advertising, and direct access models and GameLift Streams provides the flexibility to continue innovating.\nConclusion Through Amazon GameLift Streams, Jackbox Games has achieved numerous benefits:\nExpanded global reach to players worldwide Reduced operational costs through multi-tenancy and centralized management Simplified game update processes Enabled flexible revenue models (advertising, subscription) Enhanced player experience and content discoverability The partnership between Jackbox and AWS demonstrates that game streaming is not just a trend, but a platform for innovation in the gaming industry.\nAbout the Author David Holladay David Holladay is a Principal Solutions Architect with the AWS Game Tech team, specializing in consulting and supporting game studios in building large-scale infrastructure on AWS. With over 15 years of experience in software development and game systems design, he has worked with many leading studios worldwide. When not working, David enjoys streaming newly released indie games and participating in game jam events to share programming expertise with the game development community.\n"

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "AWS for Database: Real-time Iceberg Ingestion with AWS DMS By Caius Brindescu – June 4, 2025\nTags: AWS Database, AWS DMS, Apache Iceberg, Data \u0026amp; Analytics, Industries\nIntroduction Modern data platforms increasingly require the ability to access fresh data with low latency to support real-time analytics and rapid decision-making. However, many organizations struggle to continuously ingest changes (insert, update, delete) from transactional databases into their data lakes while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.\nApache Iceberg is an open table format that brings ACID transactions, schema evolution, time-travel queries, and multi-engine interoperability.\nIn this post (guest-authored by Caius Brindescu in collaboration with AWS), we discuss how to build a near real-time data pipeline using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to capture change data (CDC) from SQL databases and ingest it into Iceberg tables—ensuring consistency, fault tolerance, and seamless integration with downstream systems like Snowflake.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n1. What is AWS DMS and Why It Matters AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) is a managed service that migrates and synchronizes data across heterogeneous database engines.\nDMS supports two primary modes:\nFull Load – initial bulk copy from source to destination CDC (Change Data Capture) – captures inserts, updates, and deletes in near real-time Combining Full Load + CDC allows Iceberg tables to stay continuously updated with latency typically below 5 seconds.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n2. Pipeline Architecture: SQL → AWS DMS → Iceberg 2.1 High-Level Architecture A typical pipeline looks like:\nSource DB (MySQL/PostgreSQL) → AWS DMS → Iceberg Table on S3 → Downstream Analytics (Snowflake, Athena, Spark)\nThe transactional database acts as the origin point of change events. DMS handles the full load + CDC, and Iceberg stores the data in a scalable open table format.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n2.2 Components and Roles Component Role Source Database Generates insert/update/delete events AWS DMS Performs full load + CDC and streams data Iceberg Table on S3 ACID table storage with multi-engine access Merge/Upsert Logic Applies CDC changes to the table Downstream Systems Snowflake, Athena, Spark for analytics 3. Step-by-Step Setup 3.1 Creating DMS Endpoints Source Endpoint: Connects to SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) Target Endpoint: Points to S3 location storing Iceberg data Sample configuration includes hostname, port, username, and password.\n3.2 Creating a Replication Task Select Full Load + CDC mode\nChoose specific tables\nSet small batch sizes for low latency\nEnable large object options if necessary (LOB/JSON)\nWhen executed, DMS will:\nPerform initial full load Continuously read source logs Send changes to target staging 3.3 Handling DMS Output and Writing to Iceberg DMS writes change records (often JSON/CSV) into staging, including an action column.\nExample CDC staging:\nid name action 1 Alice INSERT 2 Bob UPDATE 3 Carol DELETE Apply changes to Iceberg using a MERGE statement:\nMERGE INTO iceberg_table t USING staging_table s ON t.id = s.id WHEN MATCHED AND s.action = \u0026#39;DELETE\u0026#39; THEN DELETE WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET name = s.name WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, name) VALUES (s.id, s.name); Conclusion Building a real-time data ingestion pipeline with AWS DMS and Apache Iceberg enables organizations to keep analytical datasets fresh, consistent, and scalable. By combining full-load initialization with continuous CDC streaming, teams can ensure low-latency updates while benefiting from Iceberg’s ACID guarantees and multi-engine interoperability. This architecture not only improves decision-making but also provides a future-proof foundation for modern analytics workloads.\nAbout the Author Caius Brindescu Caius Brindescu là Kỹ sư chính (Principal Engineer) tại Etleap, chuyên triển khai các giải pháp dữ liệu thời gian thực.

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. {\r\u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [\r{\r\u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [\r\u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34;\r],\r\u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;\r}\r]\r} Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"

	"content": "AWS for Database : Native SQL Server Replication Options on Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server (AWS Database, Amazon RDS Custom, SQL Server, Replication, Data \u0026amp; Analytics, Industries)\nIntroduction Modern applications often require reliable data distribution and high availability across multiple databases to support mission-critical business operations. SQL Server Replication enables database administrators (DBAs) to automatically distribute data across databases in near real-time, helping offload heavy read workloads from production systems and synchronizing data across regions or different database environments.\nAmazon RDS Custom for SQL Server is a managed service that combines the flexibility of a self-managed database with the automation benefits of a fully managed offering. With RDS Custom, you can leverage native SQL Server replication features while AWS handles infrastructure tasks such as backups, patching, snapshots, and monitoring.\nThis blog explores how to configure SQL Server Replication on RDS Custom, including supported replication types (snapshot, transactional, merge, peer-to-peer) and step-by-step instructions to configure distributors, publications, and subscriptions.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n1. Supported Replication Types \u0026amp; Comparison Table 1.1 Roles \u0026amp; Capabilities of RDS Custom Role / Replication Mode RDS for SQL Server RDS Custom for SQL Server Publisher No Yes Distributor No Yes Pull Subscriber No Yes Push Subscriber Yes Yes RDS Custom extends the capabilities beyond standard RDS by supporting roles such as Publisher and Distributor, which are typically disallowed on regular RDS instances.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n1.2 SQL Server Replication Types Replication Type Supported on RDS for SQL Server Supported on RDS Custom Notes Transactional Yes (as subscriber only) Yes Common for near real-time synchronization — Amazon Web Services, Inc. Snapshot Yes (as subscriber only) Yes Captures a full data state at a specific moment — Amazon Web Services, Inc. Merge No Yes (with limitations) Requires hostname instead of CNAME when host replacement occurs — Amazon Web Services, Inc. Peer-to-peer No Yes (with limitations) Needs hostname configuration to avoid host replacement issues — Amazon Web Services, Inc. Note: Merge and peer-to-peer replication on RDS Custom require using hostnames instead of CNAMEs to prevent issues during host replacement.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n2. Solution Overview \u0026amp; Architecture The original solution showcases a sample architecture with two RDS Custom instances in the same region. One instance acts as both Publisher and Distributor, while the second instance serves as the Subscriber. Replication is handled through publications and subscriptions.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\nBefore configuring replication, ensure:\nBoth RDS Custom instances are deployed with proper networking and domain setup (if using Kerberos).\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\nThe server name (@@SERVERNAME) matches the DNS hostname used for replication.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\nSQL Server Agent is enabled on both the publisher and subscriber.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\nNetwork connectivity (port 1433) between instances is properly configured.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\n3. Transactional Replication Configuration Guide Below are the steps to set up transactional replication between RDS Custom for SQL Server instances.\nAmazon Web Services, Inc.\nStep 1: Update the Server Name (SERVERNAME) if Needed Connect to each instance (publisher and subscriber) and check the current value of @@SERVERNAME.\nIf the current server name does not match the hostname/CNAME you plan to use, execute:\nSELECT @@SERVERNAME AS \u0026#39;Current_Server_Name\u0026#39;; EXEC sp_dropserver \u0026#39;old_server_name\u0026#39;; EXEC sp_addserver \u0026#39;new_cname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;local\u0026#39;; Step 2: Create the Publication on the Publisher: CREATE DATABASE PublicationDB; GO USE PublicationDB; GO CREATE TABLE Tracker ( Date DATE, RPO TIME, Status VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (RPO) ); GO INSERT INTO Tracker VALUES (CAST(GETDATE() AS Date), CAST(GETDATE() AS time(7)), \u0026#39;Success\u0026#39;); GO On the Subscriber: CREATE DATABASE SubscriptionDB; GO Step 3: Create the Publication and Subscription On the Publisher, open Replication \u0026gt; New Publication Wizard Select the PublicationDB database and choose the Tracker table as the article reate a subscription pointing to the Subscriber instance Choose a push subscription, with the agent running on the Distributor (which can be hosted on the same instance as the publisher if configured) After setup, you can monitor replication activity using Replication Monitor. 4. Advantages, Limitations \u0026amp; Considerations Advantages Supports native SQL Server replication on RDS Custom — no need to build an external replication system Provides multiple replication types (transactional, snapshot, merge, peer-to-peer) to meet different use cases Helps offload analytical workloads from the production system Limitations \u0026amp; Risks Merge and peer-to-peer replication require hostname configuration and may encounter issues during host replacement Latency may occur under heavy transactional workloads Modifying the server name (@@SERVERNAME) requires a restart and must be done carefully Replication agents (Snapshot, Log Reader, Distribution) must be monitored to avoid failures Practical Considerations Ensure DNS/hostname stability — do not rely solely on CNAMEs if host replacement may occur Confirm SQL Server Agent is configured for auto-start Configure appropriate Windows or domain accounts for replication agents (Snapshot Agent, Log Reader Agent, Distributor Agent) Monitor latency and replication errors through SQL Server Replication Monitor Conclusion Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server allows you to use native SQL Server replication features that are not supported on standard RDS instances. You can deploy snapshot, transactional, merge, or peer-to-peer replication depending on your needs, with special attention to hostname configuration, server name settings, agent permissions, and network access.\nFor environments requiring data distribution across multiple databases, high availability, or separate analytical workloads, native replication on RDS Custom provides powerful benefits without the need to build an external replication solution.\nAbout the Author Sudhir Amin Sudhir là Kiến trúc sư giải pháp cao cấp (Senior Solutions Architect) tại Amazon Web Services, làm việc tại New York.
