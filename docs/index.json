	"content": "How AWS Protects Customers from DDoS Events Overview Since late August 2023, AWS detected and protected against a new kind of DDoS event: an HTTP/2 request flood, specifically called an HTTP/2 rapid reset attack, targeting Amazon CloudFront. These floods suddenly sent huge volumes of HTTP/2 connection requests followed rapidly by resets, overwhelming servers by forcing them to log and parse requests before cancellation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\nKey Event Details The spike occurred August 28–29, 2023, peaking at over 155 million requests per second via CloudFront. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} AWS observed and mitigated multiple of these HTTP/2 rapid reset events in that period, then continued seeing them into September. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} Customers with DDoS-resilient architectures — using services like CloudFront, AWS Shield — maintained availability during those attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} Understanding HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attacks HTTP/2 allows multiple logical streams over one session, different from HTTP/1.x. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} Attackers issue many requests, then quickly reset each stream. Servers still incur overhead: parsing, logging, etc., even if response isn\u0026rsquo;t delivered. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} These are a subclass of HTTP request floods; important to detect and absorb malicious traffic before it reaches origin systems. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} AWS’s Defensive Measures and Best Practices AWS provides built-in DDoS protection across its infrastructure. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} Key services to use for resilience: Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield (including Shield Advanced), AWS WAF, Amazon Route 53, Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. These help when serving traffic from global edge locations, preventing unnecessary requests from reaching origin servers. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} Use caching at edge (e.g. CloudFront), careful filtering (WAF), and global routing/resiliency (Route 53) to absorb or block malicious traffic. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} Threat Intelligence, Monitoring, and Collaboration AWS continuously monitors for unusual traffic patterns and works proactively to detect threats. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} Engineers combine global threat intelligence, telemetry, and automated mitigation to stay ahead of new DDoS methods. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} AWS collaborates with external entities (CERTs, ISPs, registrars, other cloud providers) to trace, mitigate, and sometimes dismantle sources of large DDoS attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} Summary AWS responded swiftly to a novel HTTP/2 rapid reset DDoS attack in late August/early September 2023. Thanks to built-in protections + resilience-focused architectures using services like CloudFront, Shield, WAF, and Route 53, customers were able to maintain availability. Ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence, and infrastructure-level mitigations are central to AWS’s approach to protecting from evolving DDoS threats.\n"

	"content": "Secure Cloud Innovation Starts at re:Inforce 2025 Balancing Speed and Security Every day, I speak with security leaders who are facing an important balance. On one hand, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting breakthrough technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other hand, they need to maintain strong security controls and visibility in an increasingly complex environment.\nWe all know that simply adding more tools and security layers is not a sustainable path. We need a different approach that enables security to scale.\nre:Inforce 2025: A Security Roadmap that Accelerates Innovation This is the driving force behind our vision for AWS re:Inforce 2025. When implemented correctly, security at scale is not a barrier, but becomes a business enabler, helping organizations move faster and with greater confidence in the cloud.\nAt re:Inforce, we will share our perspective on simplifying security at scale, based on our experience supporting millions of customers worldwide. We will explore how organizations are building inherently resilient applications that both defend against modern threats and drive innovation. I am particularly excited to showcase real-world customer examples and reference architectures that demonstrate how security can directly support business objectives.\nAn Immersive Cloud Security Learning Environment We created re:Inforce as a specialized, in-person event for the security community. Unlike broad AWS events, re:Inforce provides the space to:\nDive deep into implementation details. Ask tough questions. Solve complex scenarios. Here, you can directly engage with the engineers who built AWS security services, collaborate with security partners, or schedule one-on-one sessions with AWS leaders to address your specific needs. This is the environment where true learning happens.\nWe have designed multiple learning paths to fit every stage of your cloud security journey. With more than 250 technical sessions, you will find content that matches your needs — from automating security controls, aligning development and security teams, to transforming security operations.\nKey activities include:\nInteractive workshops where you can build solutions on the spot. Small-group technical chalk talks. Hands-on labs to experiment with new approaches. “Solution-building” sessions with AWS experts. Importantly, 70% of the content is advanced or expert level, ensuring the detailed implementation guidance you need.\nJoin Us at re:Inforce 2025 I invite you to join us for three days of experience that will transform how you think about and implement cloud security.\nRegister today with code SECBLObhZzr9 to receive a limited-time $300 USD discount.

	"content": "Amazon Inspector Suppression Rules: Best Practices for AWS Organizations Delegated Administrator Setup Designate a single AWS account as the delegated administrator for Amazon Inspector. This account can centrally manage scans, aggregate findings, and apply suppression rules across all accounts in your AWS Organization. Benefits include:\nCentralized visibility of vulnerabilities Consistent policy enforcement Reduced administrative overhead Steps:\nEnable AWS Organizations and add member accounts. Assign the delegated admin role for Amazon Inspector. Verify access and permissions across accounts. Suppression Rules at Scale Suppression rules help filter out low-risk findings automatically, allowing security teams to focus on critical vulnerabilities. Key points:\nRules can be based on finding attributes, resource tags, or CVSS scores. Suppressed findings are archived, not deleted, ensuring auditability. Rules can be applied to multiple accounts using delegated admin. Example: Suppress findings for non-production EC2 instances tagged Environment:Dev with low CVSS scores (\u0026lt;4).\nTagging and Risk-Based Prioritization Using tags consistently across resources allows teams to prioritize vulnerabilities by business impact:\nTag by environment (Prod, Dev, Test) Tag by application owner Tag by compliance requirements Inspector can use these tags to generate reports and apply suppression selectively, aligning vulnerability management with business priorities.\nContinuous Review and Improvement Suppression rules and scan configurations are not “set and forget.” Continuous monitoring ensures effectiveness:\nReview suppressed findings regularly to confirm rules remain valid. Adjust scan schedules, coverage, and scope to adapt to new services or workloads. Use aggregated reports from delegated admin account to identify trends and gaps. Benefits include:\nMaintaining compliance with security standards Reducing alert fatigue for security teams Ensuring timely remediation of critical vulnerabilities Multi-Account Considerations Managing suppression rules across multiple AWS accounts requires careful planning:\nUse AWS Organizations with delegated admin to avoid rule duplication. Apply inheritance patterns for member accounts. Combine tagging strategies with suppression rules to target specific accounts or workloads. This approach provides consistent security policies while enabling scalability and flexibility for growing organizations.\nConclusion By leveraging delegated admin, suppression rules, tagging, and continuous review, organizations can efficiently manage vulnerabilities at scale using Amazon Inspector. Following these best practices ensures that security teams focus on critical issues while maintaining auditability and compliance across all AWS accounts.\n"

They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

	"content": "Mini Food Social A Serverless Social Platform with AI-Powered Recipe Generation 1. Executive Summary The Mini Food Social project is designed as a modern, serverless web application for culinary enthusiasts to share food posts, upload images, and generate AI-based recipe suggestions. The platform supports up to 100 registered users with authentication, CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete posts), likes, comments, and AI integration.\nThe system leverages AWS Serverless Architecture for scalability, low cost, and simplicity. The combination of AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Bedrock ensures end-to-end functionality with minimal operational overhead.\nAWS Services Used\nAWS Amplify: Hosts Next.js web app and manages CI/CD. Amazon API Gateway: Routes requests between frontend and backend. AWS Lambda: Handles business logic and API endpoints. Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user posts, likes, and comments. Amazon Cognito: Manages user authentication. Amazon Bedrock (Claude Model): Generates creative recipes from user prompts. Amazon CloudFront + WAF + Route 53: Ensures fast, secure content delivery. Estimated Cost: $16.70/month ($200.40/year) without free tier.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Existing recipe-sharing platforms are either static or rely on heavy infrastructure. They often lack:\nPersonalized AI recipe generation. Serverless scalability and cost optimization. Secure authentication and lightweight architecture. Managing infrastructure for dynamic social features like posts, likes, and AI generation requires significant effort and cost.\nThe Solution Mini Food Social solves these issues through a fully serverless AWS stack:\nAWS Amplify + Next.js for hosting and frontend logic. Cognito for authentication and user management. API Gateway connects to multiple Lambda functions (Post CRUD, User, AI Recipe). DynamoDB stores post metadata and user interactions. Bedrock (Claude) provides AI recipe generation via Lambda. CloudFront + WAF + Route 53 secure the content globally. Benefits and Return on Investment Low Cost – Pay only for usage. Fully Serverless – No manual scaling or servers. AI-Enhanced Engagement – Personalized recipe generation keeps users active. Secure – Cognito authentication and data encryption by AWS. The project demonstrates scalable social architecture under $20/month while integrating AI seamlessly into user experience.\n3. Solution Architecture The Mini Food Social platform follows a five-layer architecture:\nFrontend (Amplify + Next.js):\nUsers upload photos, create posts, and view feeds. Handles authentication via Cognito and fetches API data. API Gateway + Lambda Router:\nRoutes requests (CRUD operations, AI requests). Lambda functions handle createPost, getPosts, likePost, and generateRecipe. Database (DynamoDB):\nStores users, posts, likes, and recipe results. AI Integration (Bedrock):\nClaude model generates creative recipes based on user-uploaded photos or text prompts. Security \u0026amp; Delivery Layer (CloudFront + WAF + Route 53):\nProtects the app from malicious traffic. Ensures low-latency delivery of assets. Architecture Diagram 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase 1 – Research \u0026amp; Design (Month 0)\nDefine system requirements and AWS architecture. Study Bedrock integration for recipe generation. Phase 2 – Setup \u0026amp; Pricing (Month 1)\nUse AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate total cost (~$16.70/month). Create GitLab repository and Amplify CI/CD pipeline. Phase 3 – Build \u0026amp; Integration (Month 2)\nDevelop Lambda APIs for CRUD and AI recipe endpoints. Configure DynamoDB tables and Cognito authentication flow. Phase 4 – Deployment \u0026amp; Testing (Month 3)\nDeploy Amplify frontend and backend stack. Test API integration, AI outputs, and security. Technical Requirements\nFrontend: Next.js + AWS Amplify. Backend: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB. AI Module: AWS Lambda calling Amazon Bedrock (Claude) for text generation. Auth: Amazon Cognito for login and JWT verification. Storage: DynamoDB + optional S3 for image upload. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Phase Duration Description Month 0 1 month Design system \u0026amp; architecture Month 1 1 month Pricing \u0026amp; setup of AWS Amplify + Cognito Month 2 1 month Develop API Gateway + Lambda + Bedrock integration Month 3 1 month Testing, deployment, and optimization Post-Launch Ongoing Monitor, improve AI model prompts, collect feedback 6. Budget Estimation You can find the full budget on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs Service Monthly Estimate Description AWS Amplify $3.00 Web hosting \u0026amp; CI/CD API Gateway $2.50 20,000 requests/month AWS Lambda $2.00 50,000 invocations/month DynamoDB $1.20 1 GB storage Cognito $1.00 100 active users Bedrock (Claude) $5.00 500 AI recipe generations CloudFront + WAF $2.00 CDN and basic firewall Total Monthly: ~$16.70\nTotal Annual: ~$200.40\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Risk Impact Probability Mitigation High Bedrock Cost Medium Medium Limit AI calls per user/day API Gateway Bottlenecks Medium Low Use caching and CloudFront DynamoDB Hot Partition Medium Low Implement balanced keys Authentication Issues Medium Low Use Cognito token refresh and multi-region backup Over-usage Low Medium Apply API throttling and budget alerts Contingency Plans Use fallback recipe templates if Bedrock API fails. Migrate to DynamoDB on-demand mode for scalability. Enable AWS Cost Explorer alerts for budget control. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Serverless architecture allows instant scalability. AI integration enriches user interaction and creativity. Minimal maintenance and infrastructure management. Long-Term Value Demonstrates AWS serverless and AI integration for education and startup use. Reusable for future projects (social, content, or AI-based apps). Foundation for AI-driven user personalization and recommendation systems. "

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section).

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.
